# Description
This website is a memorial dedicated to the late Turkish performer Baris Manco, who passed away on February 1, 1999.

The HTML code for the website was written shortly after the announcement of his death and published on the internet at 6:00 AM. Later that day, the website was featured on several national television news programs, radio shows, and newspapers, leading to a surge in traffic.

Several radio stations reached out to request interviews about Baris Manco and web technology. The content on the website was borrowed from multiple sources, which are now unknown. It includes a quote from Manco, mp3 recordings of his songs, a form to request a photo with his signature, and screen captures of television visuals.

When visitors access the website, it automatically plays one of his most famous songs, "Gulpembe," as a mid file. This feature was considered a best practice in web development during the 1990s.

# Technical Details
The HTML on the website is unformatted and unchanged from its original 1999 version. As a result, it contains redundant and obsolete elements. The assets folder includes images used on the website.
