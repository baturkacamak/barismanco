# Info

This is memorial web page dedicated to famous Turkish performer Baris Manco who died in Februrary 1, 1999.

HTML code has written right after his dead announced at 2.15AM and web page published on the internet at 6.00AM.

Later that following evening web page was announced in couple of national TV news, radio shows and newspapers, eventually, which generated huge traffic.

Several radio stations contacted me to make an interview about Baris Manco and web technologies.

Web page content was borrowed(!) from several different sources which is unknown today. It is containing a quote from Baris Manco, his songs in mp3 format (which was hosted on a FTP server), a form which you can receive his photo with signature(?) and couple of more screen captures of TV visuals.
When you visited the web page, it has started to play his famous song Gulpembe, as mid file format, automatically which was considered a good practice during 90's web development.

# Technical

HTML is untouched and unformatted as in 1999 version. Therefore you can observe redundant and obsolete HTML.
Assets include images that used in the web page.
